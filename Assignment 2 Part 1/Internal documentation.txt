Boys work on the ALU and memory and reg write stuff

Also look into the jump implimentation from the seniors file.

Also make a main running function which uses a while loop to run the core loop of the MIPS machine

Potential points of failure:

Because we are using strings, we might accidentally be pushing an extra character "/n" sometimes resulting in failure so keep that in mind and think about a solution for it;

Look to see if certain keyword inconsistencies are present in the programme.
